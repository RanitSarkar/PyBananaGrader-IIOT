Welcome to BananaGrade-IIOT, a banana grading system with IIOT, Arduino, and Python.

## Overview

This project leverages image processing to assess banana quality using a servo motor-controlled mechanism. The integration of IIOT allows for real-time monitoring, and the system utilizes Python for image processing.

## Key Features

- Intelligent banana grading system.
- IIOT integration for real-time monitoring.
- Arduino-based servo motor control.
- Python code for image processing.
- Mobile camera integration using IP Webcam app.

## How it Works

1. Capture banana images using the IP Webcam mobile app.
2. Process images with Python for quality assessment.
3. Arduino controls the servo motor for sorting based on quality.

## Getting Started

Check out the Installation Guide to set up the system. Explore the Documentation for more details.
